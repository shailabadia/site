            Throughout our life, it is bound that there are periods of challenges that we must face, but the real challenge is how we grow and learn from overcoming them. Being naive, innocent children, we ignorantly believed that life was going to be simple and effortless. Oh, we were far from correct, we can only dream for life to be that easy. My life, in particular, has been filled with countless, tiring ups and downs. It felt like I was in an endless roller coaster of obstacles. As we mature from being children into adults, we will continue to face countless hurdles that only get bigger and more consequential. I would do anything to go back in time when I thought learning division was complicated as untying a series of knots. To when our obstacles we faced were insignificant and foolish. Thankfully, life isn't a game where we can only have one chance. Even when we stumble a thousand times, we can still manage to get back up.

            My inspiration is my family because they are always there for me and they never get tired of giving me allowance for my studying,even when they don't understand my behavior, they are always with me to guide in the right way, I made them an inspiration in my studies, that's why I really want to finish my studying so that I can repay the sacrifices of my parents.
