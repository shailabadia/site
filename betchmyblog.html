            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I woke up early in the morning, the first thing I did was to grab my phone and check all my social media accounts to see if there were any important messages or news that I received. After an hour, I collected and gathered all of my used t-shirts, shorts, and other clothing to wash them. I went to my cousin's house to do laundry and after one and a half hours, I finished the laundry and rested due to fatigue. Then, I ate breakfast and started working on my assignments so that I wouldn't have to worry about them later. After finishing my assignments, I took a shower and used my remaining time in the afternoon to relax and enjoy myself.
        When evening came, we ate dinner and went to the gym with my cousins to watch a basketball game because we had a league in preparation for the upcoming fiesta in our barangay. We were very happy because there were many people cheering for their favorite player, and then we went home to sleep.<br>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As usual, when I woke up in the morning, I checked my phone to look at my social media accounts. After that, I took a bath because we had a volleyball game scheduled for 8:30 a.m., which eventually started at 10 a.m. I didn't have time for breakfast because of the delayed game. I went home around noon, changed my clothes, and studied my schoolwork. I still hadn't eaten lunch because I fell asleep after studying. It was just a normal day.
            When evening came, I ate dinner and prepared my school uniform for Monday. After that, I went to sleep.<br>
